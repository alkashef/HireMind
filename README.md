# Hire Mind

HireMind orchestrates a CV extraction workflow that feeds candidate documents through the OpenAI API and consolidates normalized fields into CSV files stored under `data/`.

## Key Features

- Batch CV ingestion with structured CSV export to `data/applicants.csv`
- Rich server-side logging for key events (listing, picks, hashing, extraction, OpenAI calls; folder events use APPLICANTS_FOLDER and ROLES_FOLDER)
- Flask single-page UI for browsing folders, selecting CVs, triggering extraction, and viewing results
- UI now uses a 3-column layout: left-most column for the CV file list (with Select All and Extract), and two columns for details split into 6 titled sections (Personal Information, Experience, Stability, Professionalism, Socioeconomic Standard, Flags). Section titles are grey text above each table; tables share a consistent left-column width.
 - Roles tab mirrors the Applicants left-side layout: Roles Repository picker (path text box + Browse + Refresh) and a list of .pdf/.docx role files.
 - The folder path + Browse/Refresh control sits in the left column and matches the file list width; selected files are visually highlighted with a left accent line.
  
Note: the extraction pipeline is intentionally generic — it applies to both CVs (applicants) and role/job-description files. The same file-reading, OpenAI extraction, sectioning, embedding and upsert pipeline will be reused for both file types. The only differences are the downstream CSV columns/attributes and the Weaviate class properties which are mapped per-type (applicants vs roles).
- Duplicate detection by content hash; clear status bar with live progress and elapsed time
    - Duplicate highlighting marks all files in each duplicate group (both the original and its copies)
- OpenAI Responses API via latest SDK with automatic HTTP fallback; `text.format` set to `json_object`
 - Expanded extraction fields saved to CSV and shown in UI: Personal Information, Professionalism, Experience, Stability, Socioeconomic Standard, and Flags (see schema below)
 - Skips re-extraction for files already processed (by content hash)

## Technology Stack

<!-- ChromaDB removed from the project. Vector storage is planned to use Weaviate. -->

## Important Files:
- `app.py` – Flask app exposing the UI and API endpoints
- `templates/index.html` – single-page UI (file list + details table + status bar)
- `static/styles.css` – styles, including the fixed first column for the details table
- `static/status.js` – shared in-app status and progress helpers used by the UI
 - `utils/csv_manager.py` – CSVStore and RolesStore encapsulating read/write of `data/applicants.csv` and `data/roles.csv`
- `utils/openai_manager.py` – encapsulates OpenAI SDK + HTTP fallback (vector stores, file_search, text.format)
- `prompts/` – unified prompt bundle used by the OpenAI extraction flow (`prompt_extract_cv_fields.json`)
- `prompts/prompt_extract_cv_fields.json` – unified prompt bundle: `system` + `user` messages for full extraction, `fields` for ordering, `hints` for per-field guidance, `instructions`, `formatting_rules`, and an optional per-field `template`.
- `config/.env` – runtime configuration (mirrored by `config/.env-example`)
- `config/settings.py` – central AppConfig loader for environment and paths
- `utils/logger.py` – AppLogger writing to `LOG_FILE_PATH` with [TIMESTAMP] and kv helper
- `TODO.md` - developer-facing actionable task list. Keep this file in sync with
    the README's Detailed step-by-step plan; `README.md` remains documentation
    while `TODO.md` is for in-progress work items and small commits.

## Quick file reference
Brief one-line summary of core files and their primary purpose.

- `app.py` — Flask server: endpoints for listing files, extracting CVs/roles, progress, and simple admin routes.
- `templates/index.html` — Single-page UI that drives file selection, extraction actions, and displays result tables.
- `static/main.js` / `static/roles.js` — Frontend behaviour for Applicants and Roles views (selection, extract, fetch details).
- `static/status.js` — Shared status/progress helpers used by the UI.


OpenAI SDK version

- This project now targets the latest OpenAI Python SDK (see requirements.txt). The Responses API uses `text.format`; we set `text.format` to `json_object` to return structured JSON. If you previously installed a different version globally, reinstall with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

Older CSVs (from before prefixing) are read with backward-compatible field mapping so existing extractions continue to show in the UI. Employer names are now mapped under Experience (fallback reads Stability_EmployerNames).

## Setup for Development

#### Conda Environment

1. Create a new Conda environment (Windows cmd.exe):

```cmd
conda create --name hiremind python=3.11
conda activate hiremind
```

2. Install pip and build tools (if needed):

```cmd
conda install pip
```

3. Install project dependencies:

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### GPU Configuration

Local GPU/LLM setup has been removed. The project uses OpenAI APIs; no CUDA/PyTorch is required.

#### Download Models

Local model downloads are no longer needed. Extraction and embeddings run via OpenAI APIs.

 

#### Data and CSV

- The CSV pipeline (`data/applicants.csv`, `data/roles.csv`) remains the
    authoritative export. Weaviate integration runs in parallel and is optional.

## How to Test

Run the project's test suite with `pytest`. Examples:

- Run everything:

```cmd
python -m pytest -q
```

- Run specific tests (fast probes):

```cmd
python -m pytest tests/test_weaviate_local.py -q  # Weaviate probe (if running locally)
python -m pytest tests/test_extractors_local.py -q
```

OpenAI extraction report (standalone; env-driven)
-------------------------------------------------

Prefer a plain Python script that prints a clean table (no pytest noise)? Run:

```cmd
python tests\test_extract_cv_fields.py
```

Notes:
- Suppresses warnings and prints a compact table (Field | Test Output | Expected | Infer Time | Result).
- Reads all paths from environment variables loaded via `config/.env`:
    - `TEST_CV_PATH` – absolute path to the source CV PDF
    - `TEST_CV_REF_JSON` – absolute path to the reference JSON with expected values (preferred)
        - Fallback: `TEST_CV_JSON_OUTPUT` if `TEST_CV_REF_JSON` isn’t set
    - `TEST_RESULTS` – directory where the Markdown report is written
- Uses `prompts/prompt_extract_cv_fields.json` (`fields` array) for the exact field list and ordering (no extras).
- Makes a single OpenAI Responses API call to extract all fields as a JSON object.
- Shows total inference time (seconds) per row and writes Markdown to `%TEST_RESULTS%\extract_fields_openai.md`.

Tip: A cleaned, OpenAI-only reference file is provided at `tests\ref\Ahmad Alkashef - Resume - OpenAI.cleaned.json`; set `TEST_CV_REF_JSON` to this path in `config/.env` to compare against it.

Notes:
- The project is OpenAI-only and does not require local model packages.
- Prefer running tests in the project's virtual environment (`conda activate hiremind`).

Environment sourcing for tests
------------------------------

The test suite now reads runtime configuration from `config/.env` automatically
before tests run. Any KEY=VALUE lines in that file that are not already set in
the process environment will be exported into `os.environ`. This makes it
convenient to keep local settings (for example `TEST_CV_PATH` or
`TEST_CV_JSON_OUTPUT`) in `config/.env` while allowing sensitive values like
`OPENAI_API_KEY` to be provided via the shell if you prefer.

Commands (Windows cmd.exe)
--------------------------

Run all tests:

```cmd
python -m pytest -q
```

Run the PDF end-to-end tests (extraction + optional OpenAI steps):

```cmd
python -m pytest -q tests/test_end2end_extract_pdf.py -s
```

Notes about OpenAI-dependent tests
---------------------------------

- Tests that call the OpenAI API require `OPENAI_API_KEY` and valid SSL
    certificate env vars. You can either provide those in `config/.env` or set
    them in your shell. The test runner will read `config/.env` so values placed
    there are picked up automatically.

Security note: keep real API keys out of the repository; use `config/.env` as
a local-only file and ensure it's ignored by git. Keep `config/.env-example`
in the repo to show required variable names.

## How to Run

#### Web UI Mode (Default)

```cmd
python app.py
```

Starts the Flask UI on `http://localhost:5000`.

#### Batch Mode

```cmd
python app.py --batch
```

Processes the batch file specified by `QUESTIONS_PATH` in `config/.env` and writes results to an Excel file.

## Developer notes

- Developer TODOs and ongoing work items live in `TODO.md`. Keep that file
    synced with this README's Detailed step-by-step plan; `README.md` is
    documentation-only while `TODO.md` is for in-progress tasks and small
    commits.
- Safe cleaning: `scripts/clear_cache.py` now purges all contents under
    `tests/data/` (keeps the folder itself) and will never delete anything
    under `tests/ref/`. It still skips top-level `models/` and `data/` to
    avoid deleting model artifacts or user data. Use `--dry-run` to preview
    deletions.
- Configuration: use `config/.env` (local) and keep `config/.env-example` as
    the template for required and optional environment variables.


## Batch Mode

python app.py --batch

This processes a batch of questions from the file specified in QUESTIONS_PATH in the .env file and outputs results to an Excel file.

## Weaviate integration — parallel implementation (planning only)

### Purpose

This section documents a clear, step-by-step plan for adding Weaviate as a parallel vector & document store. IMPORTANT: we will not perform a migration or retire the CSV pipeline here — both systems will run in parallel during development and validation. The goal is to make Weaviate a fully-featured, optional back-end service that mirrors the CSV content (metadata + CV text + section embeddings) and provides vector search and filtered retrieval.

Schema contract: the canonical schema lives in `data/weaviate_schema.json`; point `WEAVIATE_SCHEMA_PATH` in `config/.env` to this file so the app can load and apply it at startup — the application will raise and exit if the schema file is missing or malformed.

### High-level goals

- Store structured OpenAI-extracted attributes (booleans/ints/strings) on a CVDocument record.
- Store full CV text and break it into semantic sections; each section will have its own embedding and metadata.
- Store roles as Role objects with role_text, attributes, and embeddings.
- Keep CSV export/writes unchanged and authoritative during development; Weaviate writes are concurrent and idempotent.

Note on generic handling: the pipeline is shared for both CVs and Roles — the implementation will treat each input file the same through extraction, sectioning and embedding. A lightweight mapping layer will translate the extracted attributes into the correct CSV columns (`data/applicants.csv` vs `data/roles.csv`) and into the corresponding Weaviate class properties (`CVDocument` vs `Role`).

### Design constraints

- No CSV retirement steps in this document. All work is explicitly for parallel integration.
- Small, testable commits are preferred. Each step below is scoped to a minimal change that can be validated independently.
- Schema is an explicit contract stored in `data/weaviate_schema.json` (referenced by `WEAVIATE_SCHEMA_PATH`) and must be respected by the application; the app will fail fast if the schema is missing or invalid.

Note on vectorization: this repository's schema uses Weaviate-native vectorization (`text2vec-transformers`) for documents and sections; ensure your Weaviate deployment enables the `text2vec-transformers` module (or update the schema to a vectorizer available in your environment).

### Acceptance criteria (planning)

### Acceptance criteria (planning)

- All planned steps are documented here in README and each step is small and independently testable.
- Weaviate integration is designed to run concurrently with the CSV pipeline; no migration/retirement actions are included.
- Each incremental step has a clear, minimal acceptance test (create/ensure schema, upsert CV, upsert section, retrieve CV) to reduce blast radius.

### Detailed step-by-step plan (numbered, implementation-ready)

Below is a single numbered list of small, independent implementation steps. Each step is written so it can be implemented as one small commit by an LLM agent (e.g., GPT-5 mini in agent mode). Every step includes: files to edit/create, method names (use the standardized names), a concise description, constraints and "do not do" notes, and an explicit acceptance checklist that must pass before moving to the next step.

Local Weaviate — setup & run (quick start)
---------------------------------------

If you want to run Weaviate locally for development and testing, follow these quick, platform-specific steps. The project provides a minimal `docker-compose.weaviate.yml` that launches a single-node Weaviate; adjust the compose settings to enable the `text2vec-transformers` module if you want Weaviate to compute vectors natively.

Windows (cmd.exe)

1. Make sure Docker Desktop is running.
2. From the project root, start Weaviate:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.weaviate.yml up -d
```

3. Wait a few seconds, then verify the container is running:

```
docker ps
docker logs -f hiremind_weaviate
```

4. Probe the running instance using the included lightweight test:

```
set WEAVIATE_USE_LOCAL=true
python tests/test_weaviate_local.py
```

PowerShell

1. Start Docker Desktop.
2. From the project root:

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.weaviate.yml up -d
```

3. Check status and logs:

```
docker ps
docker logs -f hiremind_weaviate
```

4. Run the probe (PowerShell):

```
$env:WEAVIATE_USE_LOCAL = "true"; python tests/test_weaviate_local.py
```

Helper scripts (Windows)

Two convenient helpers are provided under `scripts/` to start and stop the local Weaviate stack from the project root:

```
scripts\run_weaviate.bat   # starts Weaviate using docker compose
scripts\stop_weaviate.bat  # stops and removes the compose stack
```

Run them from a cmd.exe prompt in the repository root. They wrap the `docker compose` commands and print status/errors to make local dev easier.

Note about env sourcing

The `scripts\run_weaviate.bat` helper will source environment variables from `config/.env` before launching Weaviate. It parses simple `KEY=VALUE` lines (skips comments and blank lines), handles optional `export ` prefixes and quoted values, and sets them into the script process so `docker compose` picks up the same configuration used by the app. This makes it convenient to run Weaviate with the same `WEAVIATE_*` and `WEAVIATE_DATA_PATH` settings defined for local development.

Environment variable: WEAVIATE_DATA_PATH

You can override where Weaviate persists its data on the host by setting `WEAVIATE_DATA_PATH` in `config/.env` or your environment. By default the project uses `data/weaviate_data`. If you set this variable, update the compose/run commands to mount that path.

Example (cmd.exe):

```
set WEAVIATE_DATA_PATH=C:\path\to\persisted\weaviate
docker compose -f docker-compose.weaviate.yml up -d
```


Fallback: run the container directly (no compose)

If Compose has issues, you can run the Weaviate image directly (cmd.exe example):

```
docker pull semitechnologies/weaviate:1.19.3
docker run -d --name hiremind_weaviate -p 8080:8080 ^
  -e AUTHENTICATION_ANONYMOUS_ACCESS_ENABLED=true ^
  -e PERSISTENCE_DATA_PATH=/var/lib/weaviate ^
    -e DEFAULT_VECTORIZER_MODULE=text2vec-transformers ^
    -e ENABLE_MODULES=text2vec-transformers ^
  -v %cd%\\data\\weaviate_data:/var/lib/weaviate ^
  semitechnologies/weaviate:1.19.3
```

Notes & troubleshooting

- If the Docker CLI reports it cannot connect to the engine (named-pipe / EOF errors on Windows), start or restart Docker Desktop and retry. `docker version` and `docker info` should report a running engine.
- If the probe returns HTTP 200 but `tests/test_weaviate_local.py` prints "Skipping ensure_schema() (client missing)" then install the optional Python client in your virtualenv to enable `ensure_schema()`:

```cmd
pip install "weaviate-client>=3.23.0"
```

- To create the schema from the repository code (idempotent):

```
python -c "from utils.weaviate_store import WeaviateStore; s=WeaviateStore(url='http://localhost:8080'); print('ensure_schema:', s.ensure_schema())"
```

- To have `make_default_store()` pick up your environment automatically, set `WEAVIATE_URL`:

```
set WEAVIATE_URL=http://localhost:8080
```
